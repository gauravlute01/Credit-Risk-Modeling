## 💰 Credit Risk Modeling  
Credit risk modeling is a crucial process in financial risk management, aiming to predict whether a customer will **repay a loan** or **default** based on customer data.  

### 🔍 Steps in Credit Risk Modeling  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed customer data to identify patterns and correlations.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Applied statistical tests to select the most significant features related to the target variable.  
3. **Model Validation**: Evaluated model performance using various statistical and machine learning techniques.  

### 📊 Expected Loss Calculation  
The **Total Expected Loss (EL)** is computed using the formula:  

\[
EL = PD \times LGD \times EAD
\]  

where:  
- **PD (Probability of Default)**: Likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan.  
- **LGD (Loss Given Default)**: The proportion of the exposure that is lost if a borrower defaults.  
- **EAD (Exposure at Default)**: The total value a lender is exposed to when a borrower defaults.  

### 🏆 Model Performance  
- Implemented **Machine Learning models** to estimate credit risk and expected loss.  
- Calculated **accuracy scores** and other evaluation metrics to validate model performance.  
- Used risk assessment insights to enhance financial decision-making.
